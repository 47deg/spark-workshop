# Spark Workshop at Lambda World

This repository will be used at [Lambda World 2015](http://www.lambda.world/) on October 23th, 2015, celebrated in CÃ¡diz, as part of one the Workshops of Introduction to [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

## Overview

>Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.

## About Tweets Sentimental Analysis

The list of negative words and positive words used in this repository are based on these papers:

- Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews."
      Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge
      Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle,
      Washington, USA,
- Bing Liu, Minqing Hu and Junsheng Cheng. "Opinion Observer: Analyzing
      and Comparing Opinions on the Web." Proceedings of the 14th
      International World Wide Web conference (WWW-2005), May 10-14,
      2005, Chiba, Japan.

Those are used just for sample demo purposes.

Notes:

1. The appearance of an opinion word in a sentence does not necessarily
  mean that the sentence expresses a positive or negative opinion.
  See the paper below:

	Bing Liu. "Sentiment Analysis and Subjectivity." An chapter in
  	Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition,
 	(editors: N. Indurkhya and F. J. Damerau), 2010.
2. You will notice many misspelled words in the list. They are not
  mistakes. They are included as these misspelled words appear
  frequently in social media content.
